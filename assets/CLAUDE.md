# Assets Directory - Claude Guidelines

## Purpose
Contains all non-code project assets including images, wireframes, diagrams, and media files.

## Directory Structure
- **images/** - Screenshots, photos, and visual references
- **wireframes/** - UI mockups and interface designs (future)
- **diagrams/** - Architecture and flow diagrams (future)

## Current Assets
- **images/IMG_5911.jpeg** - Original handheld water game photo (project reference)

## Claude Tasks for /assets
1. **Asset Organization**: Maintain logical subdirectory structure
2. **Image Management**: Add screenshots, diagrams, and wireframes as needed
3. **Reference Updates**: Update documentation links when assets are added
4. **Quality Control**: Ensure assets meet project standards

## Asset Guidelines
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions
- **Image Formats**: PNG for diagrams, JPEG for photos, SVG for icons
- **Size Optimization**: Compress images for repository efficiency
- **Documentation**: Update references in docs/ when adding new assets

## Future Asset Categories
As project develops, add:
- **wireframes/** - UI mockups from docs/development/UI_UX_DESIGN.md
- **diagrams/** - Architecture visuals for docs/technical/ARCHITECTURE.md
- **screenshots/** - Unity setup steps for docs/technical/UNITY_SETUP.md
- **icons/** - App icons and UI elements
- **sounds/** - Audio files (if added to project scope)

## Integration with Documentation
- **Technical Docs**: Add setup screenshots to docs/technical/UNITY_SETUP.md
- **UI Design**: Create wireframe images for docs/development/UI_UX_DESIGN.md
- **Architecture**: Build system diagrams for docs/technical/ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Requirements**: Visual aids for docs/planning/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md

## Best Practices
- **Git LFS**: Consider for large binary files
- **Compression**: Optimize images before committing
- **Backup**: Maintain source files outside repository
- **Accessibility**: Provide alt text in documentation references

## Quality Standards
- **Resolution**: High enough for clarity, optimized for size
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual style across project assets
- **Relevance**: Only include assets that serve documentation or development
- **Currency**: Remove outdated assets when superseded

Keep assets organized and documented to support clear communication throughout the development process.
