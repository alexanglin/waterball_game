## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for the Waterball Game, a mobile adaptation of the classic water-filled handheld hockey game. Development follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology with a 10-week timeline.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and basic scene

**Deliverables**:
- Unity project with iOS configuration
- Git repository with proper .gitignore
- Basic hockey rink scene
- Unity Test Framework integration
- CI/CD pipeline setup

**TDD Approach**:
1. Write tests for scene loading and basic object presence
2. Create minimal scene to pass tests
3. Add tests for iOS build configuration
4. Configure project settings

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Implement basic physics without water

**Deliverables**:
- Ball physics system
- Touch input handling
- Force application system (jet placeholders)
- Boundary collisions

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test ball spawning and movement
2. Test input detection and mapping
3. Test force application to balls
4. Test collision detection

### Phase 3: Water Physics Integration (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Add realistic water simulation

**Deliverables**:
- Water physics plugin evaluation and selection
- Water particle system implementation
- Water-ball interaction
- Jet-to-water connection

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test water system initialization
2. Test particle behavior
3. Test buoyancy calculations
4. Test performance metrics

### Phase 4: Game Logic (Week 6)
**Goal**: Implement scoring and game flow

**Deliverables**:
- Score tracking system
- Goal detection zones
- Game state machine
- Match configuration options

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test goal detection accuracy
2. Test score incrementing
3. Test state transitions
4. Test win conditions

### Phase 5: UI/UX Implementation (Week 7)
**Goal**: Create polished user interface

**Deliverables**:
- Main menu system
- In-game HUD
- Settings screens
- Visual feedback systems

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test navigation flow
2. Test button interactions
3. Test settings persistence
4. Test UI responsiveness

### Phase 6: Local Multiplayer (Week 8)
**Goal**: Enable two-player gameplay

**Deliverables**:
- Split-screen implementation
- Player assignment system
- Fair gameplay mechanics
- Rematch functionality

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test screen splitting
2. Test input routing
3. Test simultaneous play
4. Test player switching

### Phase 7: Polish & Optimization (Week 9)
**Goal**: Enhance performance and aesthetics

**Deliverables**:
- Performance optimizations
- Audio implementation
- Visual effects
- Haptic feedback

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test frame rate targets
2. Test memory usage
3. Test audio playback
4. Test effect triggers

### Phase 8: Release Preparation (Week 10)
**Goal**: Prepare for App Store launch

**Deliverables**:
- App Store assets
- Beta testing via TestFlight
- Bug fixes from testing
- Launch materials

**TDD Approach**:
1. Test all features end-to-end
2. Test on multiple devices
3. Test interruption handling
4. Test first-time user experience

## Key Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Project Setup Complete | Unity project builds for iOS |
| 3 | Physics Working | Balls respond to forces correctly |
| 5 | Water Integrated | Realistic water movement achieved |
| 6 | Playable Game | Can play full match with scoring |
| 8 | Multiplayer Ready | Two players can compete |
| 10 | App Store Submission | All requirements met |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Water Performance**: Have fallback to simpler particle system
- **Physics Stability**: Implement physics LOD system
- **Device Compatibility**: Test early on older devices

### Schedule Risks
- **Water Integration Delay**: Can use placeholder physics
- **Beta Feedback**: Reserve time for addressing issues
- **App Store Rejection**: Prepare fixes for common issues

## Success Metrics
- 60 FPS on target devices
- <3 second load times
- 4.5+ star beta feedback
- Zero critical bugs at launch
- Intuitive controls (no tutorial needed)
