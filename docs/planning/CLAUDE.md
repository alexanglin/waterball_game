# Planning Documents - Claude Guidelines

## Purpose
Contains project planning documentation: requirements, game mechanics analysis, and development roadmap.

## Files in This Directory
- **GAME_MECHANICS.md** - Analysis of physical water game and mobile adaptation
- **PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md** - Complete functional and technical requirements
- **PLAN.md** - High-level development roadmap with 10-week timeline

## Claude Tasks for /docs/planning
1. **Requirements Updates**: Modify PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md when scope changes
2. **Roadmap Adjustments**: Update PLAN.md when timeline or priorities shift
3. **Game Analysis**: Enhance GAME_MECHANICS.md with new insights or features
4. **Milestone Tracking**: Ensure alignment between PLAN.md and ../TASKS.md

## Navigation Flow
```
GAME_MECHANICS.md → PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md → PLAN.md → ../technical/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## Cross-References to Maintain
- Link requirements to test cases in ../development/TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- Connect game mechanics to UI design in ../development/UI_UX_DESIGN.md
- Align roadmap with technical specs in ../technical/
- Reference performance requirements in ../technical/PERFORMANCE_TARGETS.md

## Key Principles
- **Traceability**: All requirements should link to implementation docs
- **Consistency**: Game mechanics should align with technical capabilities
- **Clarity**: Non-technical stakeholders must understand these documents
- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects from concept to delivery

When modifying planning documents, ensure downstream technical and development documents remain aligned with the updated requirements and timeline.
