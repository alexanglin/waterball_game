**Quick Links:** [Physical Game](#physical-game-analysis) | [Mobile Adaptation](#mobile-adaptation-considerations)

## Physical Game Analysis

### Core Mechanics
- **Players**: 2 players (Blue vs Red)
- **Controls**: Each player has 2 push buttons that create water jets
- **Objective**: Push floating balls into opponent's goal using water currents
- **Playing Field**: Ice hockey rink design with center circle and goal areas

### Key Elements
1. **Water Physics**: Water moves when buttons are pressed, creating currents
2. **Ball Movement**: Multiple small balls float and respond to water currents
3. **Goals**: Circular hoops on each side where balls must enter to score
4. **Center Mechanism**: Rotating element in center (possibly affects ball movement)

### Game Flow
- Players simultaneously press buttons to create water jets
- Jets push balls toward opponent's goal
- First to score set number of goals wins
- Real-time competitive gameplay

## Mobile Adaptation Considerations

### Physics Simulation
- Need realistic water/fluid dynamics
- Ball buoyancy and momentum
- Collision detection with walls and goals

### Controls
- Touch controls to replace physical buttons
- Consider tap, hold, or swipe gestures
- Ensure responsive feedback

### Visual Design
- Maintain nostalgic aesthetic of water game
- Clear view of playing field
- Visible water movement effects

### Multiplayer Options
- Local multiplayer (split screen)
- Online multiplayer
- AI opponent for single player
