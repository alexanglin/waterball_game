# Development Decisions Log - Waterball Game

**Navigation:** [‚Üê Back to Reference](DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) | [Back to Index](../INDEX.md)

## Purpose
Track important technical and design decisions for future reference. As a solo developer, this prevents forgetting why certain choices were made.

## Decision Template
```markdown
### [Date] - [Decision Title]
**Context**: What problem needed solving?
**Options Considered**: 
1. Option A - Pros/Cons
2. Option B - Pros/Cons
**Decision**: What was chosen and why
**Trade-offs**: What was sacrificed
**Revisit**: When to reconsider this decision

## Decisions Log

### 2024-01-13 - Unity Version Selection
**Context**: Need stable Unity version for iOS development
**Options Considered**: 
1. Unity 6.1 - Latest features, newest rendering pipeline
2. Unity 6.1 LTS - Long-term support, proven stability
3. Unity 2021.3 LTS - Very stable but missing newer iOS features
**Decision**: Unity 6.1 for latest features and performance improvements
**Trade-offs**: Less stability than LTS, but access to newest features
**Revisit**: If stability issues arise, consider using an earlier LTS version

### 2024-01-13 - Water Physics Solution
**Context**: Need realistic water simulation that performs well on mobile
**Options Considered**: 
1. Zibra Liquids ($199) - Best visuals, optimized for mobile
2. Obi Fluid ($90) - Good physics, requires more optimization
3. Custom particle system - Free but time-intensive
**Decision**: Zibra Liquids (pending performance tests)
**Trade-offs**: Higher cost for better performance and visuals
**Revisit**: After Phase 3 performance benchmarks

### 2024-01-13 - Architecture Pattern
**Context**: Solo development needs simple, maintainable architecture
**Options Considered**: 
1. MVC - Traditional but can be overkill
2. Manager-based - Simple, Unity-friendly
3. ECS - Performant but complex
**Decision**: Manager-based with singleton GameManager
**Trade-offs**: Less scalable but much simpler for solo dev
**Revisit**: Only if performance requires ECS

### 2024-01-13 - Testing Strategy
**Context**: Balance between code quality and development speed
**Options Considered**: 
1. 100% coverage - Thorough but slow
2. 80% coverage - Good balance
3. Critical paths only - Fast but risky
**Decision**: 80% coverage with focus on physics/gameplay
**Trade-offs**: Some UI tests skipped for speed
**Revisit**: If bug rate increases significantly

### 2024-01-13 - Version Control Workflow
**Context**: Solo development needs simple git workflow
**Options Considered**: 
1. Git Flow - Complete but complex
2. GitHub Flow - Simple PR-based
3. Trunk-based - Direct to main
**Decision**: Simplified GitHub Flow (feature branches, no PRs)
**Trade-offs**: Less process but faster development
**Revisit**: If collaborators join project
